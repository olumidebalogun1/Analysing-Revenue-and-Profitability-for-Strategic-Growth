# Script Title: Analysing Revenue and Profitability for Strategic Growth
# Author: Olumide Balogun
# Date: 2024-09-22
# The Business Challenge â€“ Why This Project Matters:
#                          In a competitive market, the company struggles to optimize revenue, profitability,
#                          and market performance. Without a data-driven approach, inefficiencies persist,
#                          growth opportunities are missed, and financial sustainability is at risk.

#                          A comprehensive analysis of revenue trends, profitability, customer segmentation,
#                          product performance, pricing, and market variations is crucial to identifying 
#                          top-performing segments, addressing revenue declines, and refining strategies. Without 
#                          analytical visibility,leadership risks resource misallocation and stagnation.

#                          To bridge performance gaps, the company must implement a robust analytical framework
#                          that delivers actionable insights, enhances efficiency, and strengthens competitive
#                          positioning. Leveraging advanced data analytics will empower leadership to drive growth,
#                          improve financial outcomes, and ensure long-term profitability.

# and enhance customer engagement. By uncovering patterns in purchasing behavior, the business can implement targeted
# strategies to maximize profitability and drive sustainable growth.

#---  Project Goal:
# This project aims to leverage clustering techniques to segment customers based on purchasing behavior, 
# revenue contribution, and sales volume. The insights gained will help tailor marketing efforts, 
# improve customer retention, and guide strategic business decisions to enhance overall profitability.

#-----   II. Key Business Question   -----#

#---  Business Question:
# Which customer segments, based on clustering, contribute the most to overall revenue and sales volume?

#---  Approach:
# Write R Script to perform customer segmentation using clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, or DBSCAN).
# Analyze the characteristics of each segment to identify high-value and underperforming customer groups.
# Develop visualizations to illustrate segment differences and revenue contributions.
# Provide actionable recommendations on targeted marketing, personalized engagement strategies, and resource optimization to enhance profitability and business growth.
