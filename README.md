## **The Business Challenge ‚Äì Why This Project Matters**:
In an increasingly competitive market, the company faces critical challenges in understanding and optimizing its revenue, profitability, and overall market performance. Leadership recognizes that without a data-driven approach, inefficiencies remain hidden, growth opportunities go untapped, and financial sustainability is at risk. To maintain a competitive edge, the company must transform raw data into strategic insights that drive smarter decision-making and long-term success.

A comprehensive, 360-degree analysis is essential to achieving this transformation. By evaluating **revenue trends, profitability metrics, customer segmentation, product performance, pricing structures, and market zone variations**, the company can identify top-performing segments, detect revenue declines, and refine pricing strategies. Without this analytical visibility, leadership risks misallocating resources, stagnating in underperforming areas, and failing to capitalize on profitable market opportunities.

To bridge these performance gaps, the company must establish a **robust analytical framework** that delivers actionable insights, enhances operational efficiency, and strengthens competitive positioning. By leveraging **advanced data analytics**, leadership can optimize growth strategies, improve financial outcomes, and ensure a resilient, profit-driven future.

By transforming complex data into clear, actionable insights, this analysis equips stakeholders with the intelligence needed to make informed, strategic decisions that drive measurable business improvements.

### **üîé Key Trends & Insights** 
**1.  Strong Positive Correlation Between Revenue and Cost Price (r = 0.99, p < 0.001)**
-	Revenue and cost price move very closely together‚Äîhigher cost prices are strongly associated with higher revenues.
-	This suggests a cost-driven pricing model, where increased costs lead to increased prices and, subsequently, revenue.
-	However, this does not necessarily mean increased profitability, as profit has a weak correlation with revenue and a negative correlation with cost price.

**2.  Moderate Positive Correlation Between Revenue and Sales Volume (r = 0.58, p < 0.001)**
-	Revenue is moderately associated with sales volume, meaning increased units sold contribute significantly to revenue growth.
-	However, the correlation is not extremely high, indicating that factors beyond just volume‚Äîlike pricing strategy, discounts, or product mix‚Äîimpact total revenue.

**3.  Profitability Has a Weak Relationship with Revenue and Volume**
-	Profit vs. Revenue **(r = 0.042, p < 0.001)** = Extremely weak positive correlation.
-	Profit vs. Volume **(r = 0.026, p < 0.001)** = Even weaker relationship.
-	These findings indicate that higher sales or revenue does not necessarily lead to higher profitability.
-	The weak relationship suggests potential issues such as high operational costs, pricing inefficiencies, or low margins despite strong sales.

**4.  Profitability Has a Slight Negative Correlation with Cost Price (r = -0.097, p < 0.001)**
-	A very weak negative correlation, indicating that higher cost prices slightly reduce profitability but not in a significant way.
-	This suggests that cost increases may not directly erode profit, possibly due to price markups covering higher costs.
-	However, it still signals a need to optimize cost structures to maximize profit margins.

**5.  All Correlations Are Statistically Significant (p-values < 0.001)**
-	The p-values are all extremely small (close to zero), indicating that these correlations are statistically significant and unlikely to be due to random chance.
-	This means we can confidently use these insights to inform business decisions.

 ### **üéØ Strategic Recommendations**
**1.  Revenue-Profit Disconnect**:
-	Investigate why higher revenue is not translating into significantly higher profits. Possible areas to explore include pricing strategies, discounting practices, and operational inefficiencies.
-	Consider conducting a margin analysis to identify low-margin products or customer segments that may be dragging down overall profitability.

**2.  Leverage Strong Positive Correlations**:
-	Since cost price and volume are both positively correlated with revenue, optimize inventory and pricing strategies to maximize high-volume, high-cost products that drive revenue without compromising margins.
-	Develop targeted marketing campaigns around premium products or high-cost offerings to capitalize on their strong revenue contribution.

**3.  Profit Optimization**:
-	Given the weak correlation between volume and profit, focus on enhancing operational efficiency rather than simply driving more sales volume.
-	Explore bundling, upselling, and cross-selling strategies to increase average order value and improve profitability per transaction.

**4.  Risk Mitigation**:
-	The negative correlation between profit and cost price suggests sensitivity to cost fluctuations. Implement cost control measures, negotiate better supplier contracts, and explore alternative sourcing strategies to maintain healthy profit margins.
  
**5.  Data-Driven Validation**:
-	Regularly update the correlation analysis to monitor changes over time, especially as market conditions, pricing strategies, and operational efficiencies evolve.

![9b  Variables Significantly Influencing Revenue Using a Regression Model](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b831d6a0-0658-4158-896a-f0d0cd1b35d8)

### **üîé Key Trends & Insights**  
**1.  Cost Price & Profit**:
-	Both cost price and profit have coefficients of **1.000e+00**, indicating a perfect, direct relationship with revenue. This makes logical sense since revenue is heavily influenced by sales price (closely tied to cost) and profit.
-	However, such perfect correlation could indicate multicollinearity, especially if cost price and profit are highly correlated with each other.

**2.  Profit Margin & Volume**:
-	Surprisingly, profit margin and volume have very small coefficients **(1.433e-14** and **4.037e-15)**, implying almost no direct contribution to revenue in the model. This might suggest that volume and profit margin alone aren‚Äôt strong predictors of revenue, or it could indicate data scaling issues or collinearity problems.

**3.  Customer Type**:
-	Negative coefficients for click-and-mortar **(-1.723e-13)** and E-Commerce **(-4.881e-13)** suggest that these customer types are associated with lower revenue compared to the baseline (likely Brick & Mortar). This insight could point to either lower sales volume or lower average order value in online and hybrid channels.

**4.  Product Type**:
-	Negative coefficients for Distribution **(-2.197e-13)** and Own Brand **(-1.763e-13)** could indicate underperformance compared to the baseline product type.
-	Third-Party Brand, on the other hand, shows a positive impact with a coefficient of **5.626e-13**, suggesting strong revenue contributions from this product segment.

**5.  Market States**:
-	States like Kano (1.264e-12) and Oyo **(6.881e-13)** have higher positive coefficients, indicating strong revenue performance.
-	Niger (-1.311e-13) and other states with negative coefficients may suggest lower revenue contributions, warranting further investigation into market dynamics in those regions.

**6.  Market Zones**:
-	NA values for markets zone indicate that these variables were either dropped from the model due to collinearity or lack of significance. This could be a red flag suggesting missing or inconsistent data.

### **üéØ Strategic Recommendations**
**1.  Revenue Optimization**:
-	Leverage Third-Party Brands as key revenue drivers; consider expanding product offerings or marketing campaigns around these products.
-	Investigate why Distribution and Own Brand products underperform‚Äîthis could indicate pricing issues, low market demand, or operational inefficiencies.

**2.  Channel Strategy**:
-	Since Brick & Mortar is outperforming online and hybrid channels, there‚Äôs an opportunity to optimize the E-Commerce experience to drive more revenue.
-	Develop a customer retention strategy targeting click-and-mortar customers, who may be less engaged or converting at a lower rate.

**3.  Market Expansion**:
-	Double down on marketing and sales strategies in Kano and Oyo, where revenue performance is strong.
-	Explore the root causes of weaker revenue in Niger and other lower-performing states, potentially adjusting distribution logistics, pricing, or local marketing efforts.

**4.  Model Refinement**:
-	Check for multicollinearity in the model, particularly between cost price and profit, as perfect coefficients may suggest overfitting or redundant predictors.
-	Consider using interaction terms (e.g., profit margin * volume) to capture more nuanced revenue drivers.

### **üîé Key Trends & Insights**
**1.  Weak Negative Correlation Between Selling Price & Profit Margin (-0.036)**
-	The selling price and profit margin have a very weak **negative** correlation.
-	This suggests that **increasing the selling price does not necessarily lead to higher profit margins** and may sometimes even reduce profitability.
-	Possible reasons: **high selling prices might lower demand, increase costs, or result in discounting to maintain sales volume**.

**2.  Strong Positive Correlation Between Revenue & Cost Price (0.991)**
-	Revenue and cost price are **almost perfectly correlated**, meaning that **as cost price increases, revenue also increases**.
-	This suggests that **products with higher cost prices generate higher revenue**, likely due to premium pricing strategies or high-value offerings.

**3.  Weak Negative Correlation Between Profit Margin & Revenue (-0.052)**
-	A **slightly negative correlation** suggests that **higher revenue does not necessarily translate to higher profit margins**.
-	This could indicate **thin margins in high-revenue products, possibly due to aggressive pricing strategies or cost pressures**.

**4.  Selling Price & Revenue Are Moderately Correlated (0.706)**
-	A strong **positive correlation suggests that higher selling prices lead to higher revenue**, assuming demand remains stable.
-	However, **since profit margin does not increase significantly with selling price, higher revenue does not always lead to higher profitability**.

**5.  Cost Price & Profit Margin Have a Noticeable Negative Correlation (-0.155)**
-	This confirms that **higher cost prices negatively impact profit margins**.
-	**Cost control remains a key driver of profitability**.

**6. Volume & Profit Margin Have a Very Weak Negative Correlation (-0.033)**
-	This suggests that **increasing sales volume does not necessarily improve profit margins**, possibly due to **bulk discounts, high variable costs, or operational inefficiencies**.

### **üéØ Strategic Recommendations**
**1.  Optimize Pricing Strategies to Balance Revenue & Profitability**
-	Since **higher selling prices boost revenue but don‚Äôt strongly improve profit margins, implement targeted pricing strategies** such as: **Tiered pricing** for different customer segments, **Value-based pricing** for premium offerings, and **Reducing price sensitivity through bundling or added value**.

**2.  Focus on Cost Reduction to Strengthen Profit Margins**
-	Since **cost price negatively impacts profit margin, reducing supplier costs, negotiating better deals, and optimizing operational expenses** can improve profitability.

**3.  Monitor High Revenue, Low Margin Products**
-	Since revenue and cost price are highly correlated, some high-revenue products may **have slim margins**.
-	**Review pricing and cost structures** to ensure these products contribute meaningfully to profits.

**4.  Improve Efficiency in Volume Sales**
-	Volume has a weak negative correlation with profit margin, meaning **selling more does not necessarily improve profitability**.
-	**Focus on increasing sales of high-margin products** and improving cost efficiencies in volume sales.

**5.  Implement Data-Driven Promotions**
-	Since selling price and profit margin have a weak negative correlation, indiscriminate price increases might harm profitability.
-	Use **price elasticity analysis** to fine-tune discount strategies and promotions.

![12   Top Customers Who Make Up 80% of Total Revenue](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44ca04eb-37fc-471c-b127-51afb24da88b)

### **üîé Key Trends & Insights** 
**1.  Revenue Distribution is Highly Concentrated Among Top Customers**
-	The top **six customers alone (Premium Stores, Nixon Hub, Excel Stores, Prime Stop Superstores, Chance Outlet, and Sunset Plaza) contribute over 47% of total revenue**.
-	This indicates that a small number of customers **drive a significant portion of the business's success**, aligning with the **Pareto principle (80/20 rule)**.

**2.  Premium Stores is the Largest Revenue Contributor (10.5%)**
-	Premium Stores generates **‚Ç¶6.83M**, making it the top revenue driver.
-	Despite having the **highest total revenue**, its **average volume value is relatively low (‚Ç¶0.21 per unit sold)**, meaning its revenue is **driven by high sales volume rather than high-value transactions**.

**3.  Excel Stores Has the Highest Average Volume Value (‚Ç¶0.35/unit)**
-	With an **above-average revenue contribution (8.67%) and a high average volume value**, Excel Stores likely focuses on **higher-priced products**, generating significant revenue from fewer transactions.

**4.  Sunset Plaza & Atlas Stores Have the Highest Pricing Power**
-	**Sunset Plaza (‚Ç¶0.40/unit) and Atlas Stores (‚Ç¶0.56/unit)** sell at premium prices compared to others.
-	Their lower sales volume suggests they may focus on **higher-margin, lower-quantity sales**.

**5.  High-Volume, Low-Revenue Customers Exist (e.g., Surge Stores & Chance Outlet)**
-	**Surge Stores sells 14.2K units but contributes only 3.21% to total revenue**.
-	**Chance Outlet sells 21.4K units yet only contributes 6.46% of total revenue**.
-	These customers **sell high volumes at lower prices**, indicating potential opportunities to **adjust pricing strategies or optimize product mix**.

**6.  Last Few Customers Have Limited Revenue Impact**
-	**The bottom four customers (Urban Finds, The Bargain Box, Riverside Enterprise, and Propel Supply) contribute less than 3.5% each** to total revenue.
-	Their **low revenue share and volume suggest that either demand is limited, or they are not purchasing at full potential**.

 ### **üéØ Strategic Recommendations**
**1. Strengthen Relationships with High-Value Customers**
-	**Premium Stores, Nixon Hub, and Excel Stores** should be top priorities for retention strategies such as:
  
i.	**Exclusive deals or priority services** to reinforce their loyalty.

ii.	**Customized promotions** based on purchasing patterns.

iii.	**Dedicated account managers** to enhance engagement.

**2. Maximize Pricing Opportunities for High-Value Products**
-	Since **Atlas Stores and Sunset Plaza have the highest average volume value**, consider:

i.	**Expanding premium product offerings** to attract other high-value customers.

ii.	**Upselling and cross-selling** strategies to increase revenue per customer.

**3. Improve Pricing Strategies for High-Volume, Low-Revenue Customers**
-	**Surge Stores and Chance Outlet** sell in **high volume but contribute low revenue**.
-	Recommend:

i.	**Reevaluating pricing strategies** for their product mix.

ii.	**Testing price elasticity** to determine whether moderate price increases could maintain volume while improving revenue.

**4.  Optimize Engagement for Low-Contribution Customers**
-	Customers like Urban Finds, The Bargain Box, and Riverside Enterprise contribute little to total revenue.
-	Evaluate whether:

i.	They are underutilizing company offerings and need targeted marketing efforts.

ii.	They could be converted into higher-value customers with discounts, loyalty programs, or bundling options.

**5.  Inventory & Supply Chain Streamlining**:
-	Use sales volume and profit-per-unit data to prioritize stock levels, avoiding overstocking low-profit items while ensuring availability for high-margin products.


## **13. The Clustering and Customer Segmentation**
### **I. Project Overview**
**üí° Business Challenge**:
The company wants to identify distinct customer segments that contribute the most to overall revenue and sales volume. Understanding these segments enables leadership to optimize resource allocation, refine marketing strategies, and enhance customer engagement. By uncovering patterns in purchasing behaviour, the business can implement targeted strategies to maximize profitability and drive sustainable growth.

**üéØ Project Goal**:
This project aims to leverage clustering techniques to segment customers based on purchasing behaviour, revenue contribution, and sales volume. The insights gained will help tailor marketing efforts, improve customer retention, and guide strategic business decisions to enhance overall profitability.

### **II. Key Business Question**
**üîç Business Question**:
Which customer segments, based on clustering, contribute the most to overall revenue and sales volume?

**üõ†Ô∏è Approach**:
-	Write R Script to perform customer segmentation using clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, or DBSCAN).
-	Analyse the characteristics of each segment to identify high-value and underperforming customer groups.
-	Develop visualizations to illustrate segment differences and revenue contributions.
-	Provide actionable recommendations on targeted marketing, personalized engagement strategies, and resource optimization to enhance profitability and business growth.
